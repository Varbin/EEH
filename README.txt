# Easy Email Host

[![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-â˜»-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/Varbin)

MDA with focus on:

 - easy configurability:
   - theoretically works without any configuration for single user setup
   - configuration is easy to learn
 - easy LDAP setup:
   - easy setup for mailinglists and users
 - easy deployment
   - Python ZIP Application with all dependencies
   - crossplatform (Windows, Posix)
   - delivery to all LMTP supporting local delivery agents and common mailboxes (Maildir, mbox)
 - easy privacy
   - supports STARTTLS
   - GPG support before saving is planned

EEH builds on Python's standart library's `smtpd` module adding STARTTLS, mailbox and LMTP delivery,
fixing Python issue 21783 (https://bugs.python.org/issue21783).

## Installation

So it's easy - how to install it?

### Basic

0. Get Python >= 3.4
1. Download EEH.pyz 
   - [to add]
2. Make it executable (not required on Windows):
   - `chmod +x /path/to/EEH.pyz`
3. Add it to autostart or services (differs from system to system)
4. Config path is (relative to EEH.pyz) `../EEH/` (on POSIX) or `./EEH/`(Windows)
5. Choose way to store mails:
   - Dummy, Filesystem or LMTP (for example to Dovecot)
6. Choose a user database:
   - File based or LDAP (for the latter see advanced topic)
